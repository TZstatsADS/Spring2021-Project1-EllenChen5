### Introduction

**2020 Exploratory Testing Survey** contains responses from 3080 adult citizens across the United States to questions about the 2020 Election. The survey data was collected in April 2020, a half year before the Election Day. Since the 2020 election admitted more mail-in ballots than usual, a series of problems towards the election integrity and fraud arised and caused a massive post-election 'fradulent mess'. 

In the questionaire, questions towards vote in-person vs. vote by mail have been addressed. After analyzing the survey data, I'd like to answer the following three questions: 

+ **Is mail-in ballot a potential cause for the 'fradulent mess'?**

+ **Will president-elect Joe Biden win/lose a lot based on the survey data?**

+ **Do Democrats favor voting by mail more than Republicans?**

```{r load packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r read data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
anes_pilot_2020ets_csv <- read.csv("~/Desktop/anes_pilot_2020ets_csv/anes_pilot_2020ets_csv.csv")
```

```{r export data, echo=FALSE}
anes_data <- anes_pilot_2020ets_csv[,c("votemail1a", "votemail1b", "votecount", "vote20jb")]
write.csv(anes_data, "~/Desktop/anes_data.csv")
```

Some basic summaries of the raw dataset:
+ There are `r nrow(anes_pilot_2020ets_csv)` respondents
+ There are `r ncol(anes_pilot_2020ets_csv)` variables

Each column correponds to one question in the survey. To find the pdf version of the questionaire: https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2020-exploratory-testing-survey/

Though many questions have been addressed in the questionaire, in this project, I will only focus on four of them. I processed the raw dataset and extract the corresponding four columns, and saved the new dataset in **data** file called "anes_data.csv". 

### Question 1: Is mail-in ballot a potential cause for the 'fradulent mess'?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("trust_mail_in.png")
```

In the ANES pilot 2020 questionaire, under **ELECTORAL INTEGRITY** section, respondents are asked whether they favor or oppose mail-in ballots and how accurate do they think the votes will be. 

Let's take a look at the answers to **votemail1a** and **votemail1b**:
```{r votemail1a, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Read answers corresponding to "votemail1a" column
Q1a <- anes_data[, 'votemail1a']
Q1a <- data.frame(Q1a)
# Factors of the answer 
factor(Q1a)
```
```{r votemail1b, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Read answers corresponding to "votemail1b" column
Q1b <- anes_data[, 'votemail1b']
Q1b <- data.frame(Q1b)
factor(Q1b)
```
```{r combine votemail1a + votemail1b, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
anes_data[, 'votemail'] = ''
anes_data$votemail[1:1499] = anes_data$votemail1a[1:1499]

anes_data$votemail[1500:3080] = anes_data$votemail1b[1500:3080]
```
The survey has been generated randomly by two different forms. In this question, people who received Form 2 have their answer in '**88**' under 'votemail1a' column. Records correpond to row #1500 to #3080 are answered by '**88**'. Similarly, under 'votemail1b' column, row #1 to #1499 are answered by '**77**'. Combine the two questions into one column named '**votemail**' and plot the distribution of answers out.
```{r plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Question 1: Do you favor or oppose conducting all elections by mail, instead of people voting in-person?
Q1 <- anes_data[, 'votemail']
Q1 <- data.frame(Q1)
ggplot(data = Q1) +
  geom_bar(aes(Q1, fill = factor(Q1))) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1,7)) +
  labs(x = "Answers", title = "Attitudes toward Mail-in Ballots") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Answer", labels = c("1.Favor a great deal",
                                                  "2.Favor moderately",
                                                  "3.Favor a little",
                                                  "4.Neither favor nor oppose",
                                                  "5.Oppose a little",
                                                  "6.Oppose moderately",
                                                  "7.Oppose a great deal"))+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
        text = element_text(size = 9, face = "bold", family = "Comic Sans MS"),
        legend.position = "bottom")
```

##### Obviously from the above plot, more people favor mail-in ballots than people who oppose. 

##### Do these people who favor mail-in ballots really trust the accuracy of the election result?


#### Among those who favor mail-in ballots, how much do they trust the accuracy of the counting process? 
```{r votecount, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Exclude those who neither favor nor oppose and those who oppose mail-in ballots, only focus on those who favor mail-in ballots
Q2 <- anes_data[(anes_data$votemail == 1 | 
                              anes_data$votemail == 2 |
                              anes_data$votemail == 3), 'votecount']
Q2 <- data.frame(Q2)
ggplot(data = Q2) +
   geom_bar(aes(Q2, fill = factor(Q2))) +
   coord_flip(xlim = c(0.5,5.5)) +
   labs(x = "Answers", title = "Attitudes toward Accuracy") +
   scale_fill_discrete(name = "Answer", labels = c("1.Not at all accurately",
                                                   "2.Not very accurately",
                                                   "3.Moderately accurately",
                                                   "4.Very accurately",
                                                   "5.Completely accurately")) +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
        text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold", family = "Comic Sans MS"),
        legend.position = "right")
```

##### Among those who favor mail-in ballots, there is still 1/6 people who do not trust the voting would be accurate. Let alone the population who oppose mail-in ballots. Thus we can conclude that the mail-in ballot is at least a potential cause for the 'fradulent mess'.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fradulent mess.png")
```




### Question 2: Would Joe Biden win/lose a lot based on the survey data? Did the survey reflect the reality of 2020 election result? If not, what are the potential reasons?
```{r vote20jb, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
Q2ans <- anes_data[, 'vote20jb']
Q2ans <- data.frame(Q2ans)
ggplot(data=Q2ans) +
   geom_bar(aes(Q2ans, fill=factor(Q2ans))) +
   coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,5)) +
   labs(x="Answers", title="Joe Biden v.s. Donald Trump") +
   scale_fill_discrete(name="Answer", labels=c("1.Donald Trump",
                                               "2.Joe Biden",
                                               "3.Someone else",
                                               "4.Probably not vote")) +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
        text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold", family = "Comic Sans MS"),
        legend.position = "right")

```
```{r percentage, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# number of respondents who will vote for Donald Trump
DT <- sum(anes_data$vote20jb == 1)
# number of respondents who will vote for Joe Biden
JB <- sum(anes_data$vote20jb == 2)
# percentage of Joe Biden's votes more than Donald Trump's
percentJB <- (JB-DT)/DT
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("2020_election_result.png")
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
percent_real <- (81281888-74223251)/74223251
```

From the survey data, Joe Biden will win `r percentJB * 100` % more than Donald Trump. From the final 2020 election result, Joe Biden won 81,281,888 votes, Donald Trump won 74,223,251 votes. Joe won `r percent_real * 100` % more than Donald Trump. The survey data did not reflect the true result of the final election result. 

Some potential causes: 

+ respondent changed their mind
+ survey bias (sample size small)
+ 'fradulent' reasons...



### Question 3: Do Democrats favor voting by mail more than Republicans?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("mail.png")
```

From previous two questions, do Democrats (or people who vote for Biden) favor voting in-mail more than Republicans (or people who vote for Trump)?

I would like to categorize data into four groups:

+ Democrats favor mail-in
+ Democrats oppose mail-in
+ Republicans favor mail-in
+ Republicans oppose mail-in

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
anes_data["Demo_Rep"] = ''

anes_data[((anes_data['votemail1a']==1) |
                        (anes_data['votemail1a']==2) |
                        (anes_data['votemail1a']==3))&
                        (anes_data['vote20jb']==2), "Demo_Rep"] = 'Democrats favor mail-in' 

anes_data[((anes_data['votemail1a']==5) |
                        (anes_data['votemail1a']==6) |
                        (anes_data['votemail1a']==7))&
                        (anes_data['vote20jb']==2), "Demo_Rep"] = 'Democrats oppose mail-in' 

anes_data[((anes_data['votemail1a']==1) |
                        (anes_data['votemail1a']==2) |
                        (anes_data['votemail1a']==3))&
                        (anes_data['vote20jb']==1), "Demo_Rep"] = 'Republicans favor mail-in' 

anes_data[((anes_data['votemail1a']==5) |
                        (anes_data['votemail1a']==6) |
                        (anes_data['votemail1a']==7))&
                        (anes_data['vote20jb']==1), "Demo_Rep"] = 'Republicans oppose mail-in'

anes_data[anes_data$Demo_Rep == "", "Demo_Rep"] <- NA
```

```{r Demo_Rep, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=na.omit(anes_data))+
  geom_bar(aes(x=Demo_Rep, fill=Demo_Rep))+
   scale_fill_manual(values=c("#0000FF", "#0000FF","#FF0000","#FF0000"))+
   coord_flip()+
   labs(x="",title = "Democrats vs Republicans")+
   theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold", family = "Comic Sans MS"),
        legend.position = "None")
```

##### Democrats favor mail-in ballots more than Republicans, around half Republicans favor mail-in ballots while also half of them oppose mail-in. 


### Conclusion
Due to the pandemic, a lot of people favor mail-in ballots. But this also increases the risk of non-accurate counting process. And people who vote for the Democrat tend to favor mail-in ballots more than people who support the Republican. This could also explain what happened after the election in Washington D.C.
