### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2021

+ Projec title: Mail-in ballots: cause for the 'fradulent mess'?
+ This project is conducted by [Ellen Chen]

+ Project summary: **2020 Exploratory Testing Survey** contains responses from 3080 adult citizens across the United States to questions about the 2020 Election. The survey data was collected in April 2020, a half year before the Election Day. Since the 2020 election admitted more mail-in ballots than usual, a series of problems towards the election integrity and fraud arised and caused a massive post-election 'fradulent mess'.

+ Are mail-in ballots the potential causes for the 'fradulent mess'?

+ Will president-elect Joe Biden win/lose a lot based on the survey data?

+ Do Democrats favor voting by mail more than Republicans? .
